Training:

http://flaws.cloud/ - flAWS challenge to learn through a series of levels about common mistakes and gotchas when using AWS
flaws2.cloud - flAWS 2 has two paths this time: Attacker and Defender! In the Attacker path, you'll exploit your way through misconfigurations in serverless (Lambda) and containers (ECS Fargate). In the Defender path, that target is now viewed as the victim and you'll work as an incident responder for that same app, understanding how an attack happened.
